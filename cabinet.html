<h1>Time for a recap of what has happened</h1>
<p>Over the past few months sence the election I have neglected to properly cover anything, mainly to take a break from polotics, but now I'm back and BOY HOWDY do we have some magnificent displays of assinine bull to cover!</p>
<h3>assinine bull</h3>
<p>Lets talk Rump's cabinet</p>
<p>Disregarding the neo nazi he has as his acid spiting pet, I mean vice presedent... nope. I ment the first one, we have some arce tarts that I would call a gang of idiots but I somewhat respect MadMag. For the secretary of education he chose a moron who doesn't know a thing about education named Betty DuVus who suggested keeping a gun in the bleating classroom fo BEARS. I was under the influence that schools are suppost to be a safehaven area where you can be away from guns. Moving on from that in the chair for Urban development is... the only black man he knows, Ben Carl. Realy... there is more that just blacks in the inner city and blacks are not all in the inner city. I realy dont get it. As for secritary of the tresury they chose someone who proper looks like a weasel with specticals.</p>
<p>I'm kinda scared for the next four years</p>
