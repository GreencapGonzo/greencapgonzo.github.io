<p>Trump got elected.</p>
<p>After the countless things he has done includeing (but not limited to mind you) Mocking the disabled, dodgeing taxes, and faceing a court date for CHILD RAPE... all these things just roll off his back and we elect The Donald. As a lifelong Democrat and a liberal I am whole heartedly apappalled... but as a reporter who enjoys geting angry and dirty laundry... I'm ready to have a damn field day with that racist cheeto. </p>
<p>The next four years will suck but like with the infamous George DUBBYA Bush... nil will actually happen. Just you see. It will mess us up , but we might as well laugh about it as we will be crying for the rest of this miserableterm once we stop.</p>
