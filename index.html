<h1>Greencap Gonzo Journalism</h1>
<p>This is the first attempt at Greencap Gonzo Journalism. The term Gonzo Journalism was first coined and performed by Hunter S. Thompson. By completely immersing the reporter in his/her own story they completely forfit any claim of not being biased. Enter Greencap Socialism, an underground movement of center-left based around people being nice to each other... unless they are mean to you... then screw them. The concept of Greencap is anti-profesional, and the point of Gonzo is anti-anti-bias so this is a website for people who want libral news that is biased, unprofesional, and not stupid.</p>
