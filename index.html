<h1>Greencap Gonzo Journalism</h1>
<p>This is the first attempt at Greencap Gonzo Journalism. Gonzo Journalism was first coined and preformed by Hunter S. Thomson. By completely emersing the reporter in his/her own story they completely forfit any claim of not being biased. Enter Greencap Socialism, an underground movement of centere left baced around people being nice to each other... unless they are mean to you... then screw them. The consept of Greencap is anti profesional and the point of Gonzo is anti anti bias so this is a website for people who want libral news that is biased, unprofesional, and not stupid.</p>
<p>This website is the following things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Libral</li>
<li>Unreliable (we program alll this right into the HTML so we cant be bothered to precheck or it will be irelevent</li>
<li><b>UNDER CONSTRUCTION</b></li>
